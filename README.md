# Short Project

Decided to use something that I am less familiar with such as nodejs in order to show off my learning ability instead of doing this with tools that I am familiar with.

Picked W3.css instead of Bootstrap for responsive web due to me never using it until now.

Was using SQL Server for previous project which got cancelled, therefore wanted to have some additional practice, hence used it for this. Extra challenge since mssql is not native to macos therefore I had to run it via docker.
